 <h1>Welcome to MandyBM!</h1> MandyBM is an HTML program that runs bookmarklets in about:blank. It's very useful if bookmarklets don't work on your device or if they are blocked by your administrator. While the purpose of bookmarklets is lost in MandyBM, (that is, being able to run code in any website) some bookmarklets are still useful and fun to mess with!
  <h3>Please allow popups on this page to launch MandyBM. It is sourced from <a href="https://blobby-boi.github.io/uBlobeBM/">BlobeBM on Github. </h3> A better version of MandyBM that can run code on any page <a href="https://blobby-boi.github.io/uBlobeBM/">can be found here!</a>
